# SQL for Absolute Beginners

Welcome to the **SQL for Absolute Beginners** folder! This section of the repository is designed for those who are just starting their journey with SQL. Here, you'll find a collection of fundamental SQL queries and concepts that serve as the building blocks for working with databases. Whether you're new to SQL or need a refresher, these projects will help you understand the basics and gain confidence in writing SQL queries.

## What You'll Learn:

1. **Creating Basic Tables**:
   - **Overview**: Learn how to create tables to store data in a structured format.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Employees (
         EmployeeID INT,
         FirstName VARCHAR(50),
         LastName VARCHAR(50),
         Department VARCHAR(50)
     );
     ```

2. **SELECT Statements**:
   - **Overview**: Understand how to retrieve data from a database using the `SELECT` statement.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;
     ```

3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - **Overview**: Filter data based on specific conditions using the `WHERE` clause.

     SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'HR';
     ```

4. **GROUP BY Clause**:
   - **Overview**: Group data based on one or more columns and perform aggregate functions.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount FROM Employees GROUP BY Department;
     ```

5. **HAVING Clause**:
   - **Overview**: Filter groups of data after applying the `GROUP BY` clause using the `HAVING` clause.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount FROM Employees GROUP BY Department HAVING EmployeeCount > 5;
     ```

6. **ORDER BY Clause**:
   - **Overview**: Sort the result set of a query by one or more columns using the `ORDER BY` clause.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName ASC;
     ```
